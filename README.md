# SmartInternz-Project

This is a personal GitHub repo made for the final submission of the Smartinternz Externship.

## Assignments

- Assignment 1: This assignment is a very simple one that requires us to make 5 simple graphs in tableau.

- Assignment 2: This assignment requires us to apply three different features to some simple graphs in tableau.

- Assignment 3: This assignment requires us to create a simple story and a dashboard using Tableau.

## Project

- We have oour simple project made in flask. You only need to open the file and run `python app.py` to run our project.

- The folder structure is very simple and intuituve.

    - We have a central **app.py** file which has a very simple syntax.

    - A separate Readme for working with the project.

    - A static folder that contains all assets and bootstrap files like js and css.

### Description

This project aims to analyze and understand the factors influencing medical care costs and provide valuable insights using data visualization techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive insurance dataset, we explore the relationships between age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and region with medical charges. Through interactive visualizations and statistical analysis, we uncover patterns, trends, and significant factors impacting healthcare expenses.

### Features

-> Interactive dashboards and visualizations
-> Comparative analysis of medical charges based on age, sex, and BMI
-> Exploration of the relationship between smoking and healthcare costs
-> Regional analysis of medical charges and BMI distribution
-> Odds ratio analysis to determine significant factors affecting charges
-> User-friendly interface for easy data exploration and insights
